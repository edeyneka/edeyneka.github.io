In 2017 I applied to a couple of leading European universities and scholarships. I was accepted to TU Delft, EPFL, UPF in Barcelona. In this blogpost I will share the most important things you need to know when applying to European schools, i.e. how to choose a program, scholarships, CVs, motivation letters, contacts with professors, recommendation letters. Finally, some info about PhD in Europe which is based on my friends’ experiences. So, let’s begin.

### How to choose a program?

It is crucial to apply for a program that is a logical continuation of your previous studies. I would say that in Europe it is a must. I applied to several programs in ETH and got rejected because I chose engineering programs, not scientific. I though that if I passed theoretical physics at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), then I will be able to pass everything in the world 😃 However, ETH committee has a different opinion. Another example. My program at TU Delft, Nanobiology, has 3 majoring courses: Maths, Physics and Baiology. And I was just a perfect fit to this program. I suppose this was one of the reasons for them to choose me. If you want to check if you are eligible for a program, look at the bachelor’s curriculum and find out if you had all those classes during your bachelor. Moreover, check master’s curriculum and see how competent you are for the future courses. If you are not sure about your eligibility, write to the application committee and verify how strict they are with the courses.

I mentioned some basic and formal strategies on how to choose the program. Of course, everything is up to you and your interests, although keep in mind the things I have mentioned.

### Scholarships

I am always saying that being accepted to a uni is not that difficult as getting funding to cover studying and living expenses. There are some nuances. Education in Germany and Switzerland is almost free, however, in the Netherlands for non-Europeans it is very costly. At the same time, living in Switzerland can be enormously expensive. Keep this in mind. Of course, receiving a full scholarship can be challenging and you need to have some exceptional results for that. For example, high grades. No matter how often you have heard that grades do not matter and the knowledge is top priority, GPA matters A LOT when applying to foreign programs and scholarships. The reason for that is that they do not have any other way to asses you. I suppose that my high GPA was crucial for TU Delft as well as the unique combination of Maths, Physics and Biology. Also, be ready that the deadlines for the most of the scholarships are EARLIER than the deadlines for the corresponding universities. Usually, for the scholarship, you will need to write a separate motivation letter or even a research proposal. Some tips on how your scholarship motivation letter should look like:

1. Emphasize your contribution to the society if you are accepted to the program

2. Be specific on what you want to do during your master (research, internships). Even if you are not 100% sure that exactly these topics will be your research focus. To give more realistic details, you can reach out to professors whose works are interesting to you (for details see section contacts with professors)

3. Mention your future aspirations - yes, they like determined candidates. You always need to have a plan on what to do in the future

4. Focus on global aspects rather then tiny details of your possible research - people who assess scholarship applications can be not professionals at your particular area

My scholarship in TU Delft was around 55K €, 30+K to cover the study costs for 2 years and ~22K were paid out to me as a 860€ monthly stipend. 500€ of them I spend on the housing and 360€ were left which is not that much. I always tried to find alternative ways to earn money and the best option is teacher assistantship.


### Documents

A standard application includes: certificate of English proficiency, your transcripts in English, motivation letter, recommendation letters (2 or 3).

**Certificate of English proficiency.** I wrote a detailed guidance on IELTS and TOEFL. You need just to pass these test. If you have 9.0/9.0 for IELTS, it is not likely to give any extra points to your application.

**Transcripts in English**. You need to come to the international relations department at your current university and ask for the transcripts in English. If they do not provide such documents, you need to translate by yourself and then come the international relations department to verify that your translation is valid. Note, that your GPA is very important in such applications. My suggestion is to keep that in mind and always try to do you best during the exams and if you have an opportunity to retake something, grab it. You never know when these grades will play a role in your life.

**CV.** This is your front of your application. It should be short and concise and reflect the most relevant experience. Try to recall all your achievements: all scholarships, awards, speeches, teaching experience. Also, I strongly suggest Latex, or Overleaf, for writing your CV - it looks professional and will help you to stand out from others. Here are some useful tutorials for mastering Latex: [https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)

As an example, my CV from 2018.

**Motivation letter.** This is one of the most important document in your application. Here, you need to show that you are the person they are looking for. Try to focus not only on what you will gain out of this program, but how the university / research community / global society will benefit from your expertise. Of course, you might exaggerating a bit about your contribution, but at the same time you need to sell yourself. I know that Russians, especially Russian girls including me, are not good at self-marketing because throughout all our life we have been taught “not to show off”, “sit quietly” and so on. For the Western world it does not work.

Also, try to substantiate everything that you write about yourself with a real (or almost real 😄) fact. For example, if you are saying that you would like to eventually become a professor, you can mention that you really enjoy teaching and have been teaching and developing a bunch of courses. If you are saying that you are very patient and determined, you can describe that you had always been bad at running and recently you have run a marathon. Always try to think about life situation that proves your qualities and aspects of your character. No unsubstantialed statements.

Over and over again, do not start your letter with “since my childhood I have been wondering how the universe works and bla bla”. Come on, you are not at kindergarten, you are serious grown ups who want to receive a decent degree! Try to find something that really resonates with you and your passions. And do not worry if you cannot come up with anything. It is normal. When I was applying to the master’s, I still did not have any clear picture on what I would like to do. To be honest, I’m still not sure, although the picture have become clearer and clearer for the past years. Some examples on how to start from my motivation letters:

> I am convinced that Program X is the best option for me due to well-grounded reasons. First, the program exactly corresponds to my interest in implementing computational models and tools in biomedical sphere. IT actively assists in experimental research and helps to analyze huge amount of biological data. Computational approach can solve various biological problems and give answers to urgent questions concerning human health. Therefore, I find this area very interesting and challenging. I am so fascinated about combining mathematical, biological, chemical knowledge with computational approaches for the development of life science technologies that it drives me to deepen in this area and choose it for my master education.
*2018*

**Be specific on your interests.** Try to describe what you have done so far and how it has lead you to your current preferences in research. Be specific, even if you are not 100% sure about this area. Everybody understands that life can change and interests can and should change, so do not worry. Just try to avoid any hand waving and general phrases like “I would like to beat cancer”.

Having said the main points for the whole motivation letter, let me give the overall structure.

1. Introductory paragraph on who you are and why are you writing.

2. Why you choose this university and program. Which lab are you interested in joining

3. Your background / interests

4. Conclusion

You can change the order 1→2→3→4 to 1→3→2→4

**Contacts with professors.** This is very important yet not obvious thing to do.

In order to be specific in your motivation letters, you need to have at least some information on which lab you would like to join, what the ongoing projects are, do they work with master students. Therefore, I suggest contacting the professors of interest in advance and ask them about possible research projects. Prior to that you can scroll the lab website or read the latest papers. Professors might answer that you are too early, in this case just ask them to tell more about their current research. Maybe some of them will give you a small research task, so that you can show your determination and skills. Here is an example of the letter to professors:

> Dear Prof. X,
>I am a prospective student of the Y program and I am writing concerning possible masters project at your lab. I am very passionate about X, Y, Z (something that aligns with their research). I am going to apply for a masters program in X and wanted to ask if you are taking students next year? If yes, what could be a possible topic for research project at your lab?
>I feel that my research and academic background can offer substantial assistance in your research.
>Few words about myself. ... Attached you can find my CV for more information.
>Look forward to your reply!
>Sincerely yours,
>X Y

Interesting fact. In 2017 I contacted two professors at TU Delft and both of them were in my thesis committee in 2020. And I am very grateful for them that they answered because it gave me extra motivation.

**Recommendation letters.** Oh, this is the worst part of the application. Even if I have always been a good student, it is painful to ask for the recommendations. Therefore, don’t worry if you feel uncomfortable asking! Everybody does. Everything depends on a particular supervisor, but here are some general tips.

1. Find someone who can say more than “I saw X attending my course”

2. If you want to have a recommendation from a particular person who haven’t have an opportunity to assess your qualifications, just reach out to them and explicitly say that you are seeking for recommendations and maybe you can help with some research project, or teaching.

3. Usually you will write a recommendation template for yourself, and here you have to praise yourself. It is difficult, but remember that in western culture a “good student” is a “bad student”. Therefore, multiply the complements by 2 😄 Just remember this distribution:

4. Sometimes you will need to ping your referees and it is fine, just do it in the polite way. I know you might feel uncomfortable but this is life and you have to be persistent no matter that others will think of you (to be honest, nobody actually thinks of you 😃)

### PhD in Europe

Based on what I have seen and my friends’ experience, PhD application for European universities is more relaxed. There are some unis that have application process similar to masters. But usually you just need to write directly to the professor and they will set up an interview. In many cases, you will not need even an English proficiency exam. PhD is regarded as work in Europe and you will be paid more or less well compared to the US. If you come to the Netherlands, for example, you as a foreign worker will have 30% of your income non taxable (the Dutch 30% ruling). Nice think to be aware of :)

There is not much I can say about PhD in Europe. If you want to share your experience here at my blogpost, email me and I will share your thoughts with great pleasure.
