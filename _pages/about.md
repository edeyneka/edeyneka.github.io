![Hi](/images/intro.png)

I am a researcher in the field of computer vision and bioinformatics. I am originally from Russia where I acquired my bachelor degree @ MIPT, then I spent two years in the Netherlands while studying @ TU Delft and now I am based in California, United States. 

I relocated to California in 2020 in the middle of the global pandemia to do PhD in Computer Science. Althout, it was quite challenging to adapt in such circumstances, I finished the first PhD year with 4.0 GPA and successfully went through interview process in Apple, Google and Snap Inc. for a summer intern position. I chose Snapchat and compeleted 12-weeks internship working on denoising diffusion models. It was amazing experience which, I believe, will boost my skills in the field of computer vision. Also, I hope, I was able to contribute to the current developments of the ML team. Many thanks to all the colleagues and especially to my managers. 

I have extensive experience in applications to European and US universities and one of the reasons for creating this website was to share my insights on [International Exams](/posts/2021/09/ielts-toefl-gre/) and [Master’s Application in Europe](/posts/2021/09/masters-application/). I know how challenging it might be to go through this alone, therefore, if you know anyone who is applying, share my posts with them. I hope, it will be useful. If you have any questions, reach out to me by email, I am always happy to help.

Also, I am planning to write about the applications for PhD programs in the US.

Apart from academia and coding, I am passionate about healthy lifestyle, workouts, running, and cooking healthy food. Checkout my food blog [@my.eatittude](https://www.instagram.com/my.eattitude/)
